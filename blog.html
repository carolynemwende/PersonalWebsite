			<h3>Saiwa Swamp National Park</h3>
			<p>This is a place I woun't like to miss. Before I plan to go to spain as many aspire to,I must visit Saiwa. It is one of the smallest parks in kenya but full of incredible scenaries and peculier creatures. It is in saiwa that you will get to see the Sitatunga antelope which is semi aquatic and a great creature to always look at.
			What completes the place  is the wondeful tree house present in the place and a place where you get to capture a nice view of the park.Take a tour to the saiwa and you will forget  about going to spain.

			<h3>Lord Egerton Castle</h3>
			<p>It's a reflection of love and heart break at the same time. It is a place that when you think about a nolstagic feeling fills you. The story of the place is quit emotional. Lord Egerton Castle was build by Egerton for his wife who never stayed there for more than two hours inspite of the expensive castle. This broke  Egerton heart and he grew to not love women any more,too bad. The place showcases great art and this makes it one of the most eye catching places in the country.It truly is a marvellous place to tour. Miss at your own will but what I would advice you is, check it out and thank me later.</p>
